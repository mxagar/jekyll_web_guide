# Basic HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap: A Guide

These are my personal notes related to HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. They are focused to creating and deploying static web pages with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com): instead of creating HTML & CSS files from the scratch, small snipets need to be written and modified when using Jekyll.

These notes originated from various sources, among others:
