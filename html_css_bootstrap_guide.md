# Basic HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap: A Guide

These are my personal notes related to HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. They are focused to creating and deploying static web pages with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com): instead of creating HTML & CSS files from the scratch, small snipets need to be written and modified when using Jekyll.

These notes originated from various sources, among others:

- The Udemy course by Jos√© Marcial Portilla [Python and Flask Bootcamp: Create Websites using Flask!
](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-flask-bootcamp-create-websites-using-flask)

# 1. HTML

The files generated in this section are located in `06_HTML_basics/`.

Note that Sublime and Atom have HTML file autocompletion.

## General Notes

- HTML files contain the content.
- CSS files define the style.
- Bootstrap automates style elements.
- If we have a dynamic page, we're going to need a database (SQL).
- The programming and handling of the different elements is done with Javascript; however, we can use a web framework, like Flask, which allows programming the behavior in python.

## Basic HTML File Structure

The very basic HTML file create by autocompletion is the following `basic.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
	<title>This is my title!</title>
</head>
<body>
This is the content.
</body>
</html>
```

Notes on the code:

- DOCTYPE tells the browser we have an HTML file.
- HTML works with tags that are opened `<html>` and sometimes closed `</html>`.
- We have 2 main parts in a HTML file: 
	- head: metadata, linkings to JS & CSS files, etc.
	- body: content
