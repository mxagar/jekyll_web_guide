# Basic HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap: A Guide

These are my personal notes related to HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. They are focused to creating and deploying static web pages with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com): instead of creating HTML & CSS files from the scratch, small snipets need to be written and modified when using Jekyll.

These notes originated from various sources, among others:

- The Udemy course by Jos√© Marcial Portilla [Python and Flask Bootcamp: Create Websites using Flask!

# 1. HTML

The files generated in this section are located in `06_HTML_basics/`.

Note that Sublime and Atom have HTML file autocompletion.

## General Notes

- HTML files contain the content.
- CSS files define the style.
- Bootstrap automates style elements.
- If we have a dynamic page, we're going to need a database (SQL).
- The programming and handling of the different elements is done with Javascript; however, we can use a web framework, like Flask, which allows programming the behavior in python.

## Basic HTML File Structure

The very basic HTML file create by autocompletion is the following `basic.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
	<title>This is my title!</title>
</head>
<body>
This is the content.
</body>
</html>
```

Notes on the code:

- DOCTYPE tells the browser we have an HTML file.
- HTML works with tags that are opened `<html>` and sometimes closed `</html>`.
- We have 2 main parts in a HTML file: 
	- head: metadata, linkings to JS & CSS files, etc.
	- body: content

## HTML Tagging: Titles

In HTML there are elements or tags which have a structural or style meaning: titles, lists, paragraphs, etc.

Heading tags: `<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>`. There are 6 levels: `<h2>, <h3>, ...`

Spaces are not registered unless we use a paragraph tag: `<p>Text</p>`.

Trick: type `lorem + TAB`: Lorem Ipsum text is filled!

Bold and italics: `<p><strong>strong is bold</strong> and <em>emphasis is italics</em></p>
`.

## Lists

Lists can be:

- Numbered, ordered: `<ol>`
- Bullet points, unordered: `<ul>`

Inside a list, no matter the type, we add list elements with `<li>`.

We can also nest lists by just simply adding new lists below a list item.

```html
<p>A numbered list (ordered):</p>

<ol>
	<li>First item</li>
	<li>Second item</li>
	<li>Third item</li>
</ol>

<p>A bullet list (unordered):</p>

<ul>
	<li>First item</li>
	<li>Second item</li>
	<li>Third item</li>
</ul>
```

## Divs and Spans with HTML

With divisions and spans, we can segment the page and later on apply different CSS styles to each segment:

- `<div class="">` is used for larger page divisions in which we link a CSS style class, empty in the following example; if it's empty, nothing happens in the page.
- `<span class="">` is used for sentence parts; we link the CSS style class	as in the division.

```html
<div class="">
	<p>This is a sentence in a division.</p>
</div>

<p>This is in a <span class="">span</span></p>
```

## Images and HTML Attributes

Some HTML tags have attributes or properties, such as `class`, `src`, etc.

Images, for instance, require a `src` for the source URL or path and optionally an `alt`, i.e., alternative image path/URL or string to display if the original image is not found. Additionally:

- Note that the image tag is not self-closing: everything is defined inside a unique image tag.
- Images have further attributes, like `width` and `height`.

```html
<img src="image.jpeg" alt="Uh oh, image not found...">
<img src="https://my.image" alt="Uh oh, image not found...">
<img src="https://my.image" alt="Uh oh, image not found..." width="100">
```

## Hyperlinks: Anchor Tags

Hyperlinks or anchor tags are defined with `<a>`.

```html
<!-- Link to current HTML file -->
<a href="#">This is my link</a>

<!-- Link to an URL -->
<a href="https://mikelsagardia.io">This is my link</a>

<!-- Link to an file -->
<a href="another_page.html">This is my link</a>

<!-- An image with a link -->
<a href="https://mikelsagardia.io">
<img src="eberhard-grossgasteiger-nVOPBYchSTY-unsplash.jpg" alt="mountains" width="150" height="70">
</a>
```

## Forms

Forms have `<input>` elements inside, each being a field to be filled in. We have many input `types`: text, email (correctness is checked), password (entered text is not visualized), submit (button), etc.

```html
<form>
	<h1>Log in</h1>
	<h1>Please input your email and password:</h1>
	<input type="email" name="">
	<input type="password" name="">
	<input type="color" name="">
	<input type="text" name="">
	<input type="submit" name="" value="Submit">
</form>
```

We can extend that basic form as follows:

- We can define `<labels>` which match with `<input>` `id` properties: `for` recceives the `id` value.
- We can add `value` so that it's displayed, or better, `placeholder`, so that it's displayed in gray.
- The `action` attribute connects the form with another HTML page (a file or URL). There, we apply a `method`, which can be `get` or `post`:
	- `method="get"`: data in the given representation is requested.
	- `method="post"`: data is submitted to be precessed.

```html
<form action="http://www.google.com" method="get">
	<label for="emailtag">EMAIL:</label>
	<input id="emailtag" type="email" name="useremail" value="" placeholder="my@email.net">
	<br>
	<label for="passtag">PASSWORD:</label>
	<input id="passtag" type="password" name="userpass" value="" placeholder="password">
	<br>
	<input type="submit" name="" value="Submit">
	<!-- We we hit Submit, the content of the form is passed to the action HTML page
		 and, since we use the get method, information is requested:
		 https://www.google.com/?useremail=my%40mail.com&userpass=test 
	-->
</form>
```

We can have more sophisticated `<input>` elements, such as:

- Radio buttons
- Drop-down menus
- Text area inputs

```html
<form>
	<h3>Do you already own a dog?</h3>
	<!--Input radio types that share the same name attribute are connected -->
	<label for="yes">Yes:</label>
	<input type="radio" id="yes" name="dog_choice" value="yes">
	<label for="no">No:</label>
	<input type="radio" id="no" name="dog_choice" value="no">

	<h3>How clean is your house? (1-3)</h3>
	<!--The browser shows 1/2/3 but the data processed is the value Bad/Good/Great-->
	<select name="stars">
		<option value="Great">3</option>
		<option value="Good">2</option>
		<option value="Bad">1</option>
	</select>

	<h3>Any other comments?</h3>
	<!--Text box with custom size -->
	<textarea name="textbox" rows=8 cols=80></textarea>

	<input type="submit" name="" value="Submit Feedback">

</form>
```

## Other HTML Elements and Notes

- Vertical break: `<br>`
- Comments: `<!-- ... -->`
- Sometimes we can combine tags, e.g., links and images.
