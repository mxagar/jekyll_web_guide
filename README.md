# Jekyll Website Development and Deployment Guide

This repository contains my personal notes related to creating and deploying static web pages with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), using Markdown, Liquid, HTML and CSS.

The repository contains the following files/guides:

- [jekyll_guide.md](jekyll_guide.md): Jekyll web development from creation to deployment.
- [html_css_bootstrap_js_guide.md](html_css_bootstrap_js_guide.md): Basic notions on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and jQuery.

The folders `01_* - 08_*` contain examples referenced in the aforementioned guides.

For basic website back-end development and deployment, see my repository on Flask: [flask_guide](https://github.com/mxagar/flask_guide).
