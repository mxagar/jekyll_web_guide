# Jekyll Website Development and Deployment Guide

This repository contains my personal notes related to creating and deploying static web pages with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

The notes originated from various sources, among others:

- The Youtbe [tutorial by Mike Dane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB).
- The orginal [Jekyll documentation page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

Contiunue on `./jekyll_guide.md` for the real contents / guide.
